Create database ass2;
Use ass2;


create table Employee (Employee_Id int(10),

Select * from Employee;

create view v1 as
select Employee_Id,Employee_NAME,City from Employee;
select * from v1;

Create index on Employee(Employee_Id);
Show index from Employee;

ALTER TABLE Employee
DROP COLUMN Salary ;
